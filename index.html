        <p class="infoAboutMeP" >Hello! my name is Renan Andrade de Almeida, I'm 22 years old, currently I study ADS on IFRN, but before that I studied Chemistry on UERN in Mossor√≥/RN, after many events I came here and now I really study what I always wanted :D.</p> <br>
        <p class="infoAboutMeP">What happened for me to choose this challenge? I was very sedentary and also needed to save money, so linking business with pleasure I walk to home everyday after than class.</p>
